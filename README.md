# Documentation

There are 4 types of notes:
- Plain text
- Ordered list
- Unordered list
- Checkboxes


Questions to answer for implementation:
- Will cards be of a set of defined colors?
  - If so, which ones?

# TODO (Priority)

Simple
- Add min width and height to a notes-card component

- How to use user data?

<!-- Do this one after Forms course?? -->
- Component: Editable card (title and content)
  - Modify title
  - Modify text body

- RouteGuards (Sign In)


Card Menu - Functionalities
- Color (change) -> needs a Dialog showing possible colours 
- Format (change) -> needs a Dialog showing possible formats (text, checkbox)
- Duplicate Note -> function that creates a copy of a note in db
- Attach File -> something like "Share Note" but with files, maybe same component! (We can add/remove... can we open?)
- Share Note -> needs dialog box showing the list of emails with which the list has been shared
- Delete Note -> needs dialog asking are you sure 




- Use ExpansionPanel for file attachments and maybe the list of users who the card is shared with.
